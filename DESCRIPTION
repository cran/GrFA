Description: Several group factor analysis algorithms are implemented, including Canonical Correlation-based Estimation by Choi et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.09.008> , Generalised Canonical Correlation Estimation by Lin and Shin (2022) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4295429>, Circularly Projected Estimation by Chen (2022) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2022.2051520>, and the approach we recently proposed, named Weighted Projection Estimation.
